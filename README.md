# mis-vqa-portfolio-construction
The rise of quantum computing has revolutionized several fields due to the potential for quantum computers to efficiently solve problems in areas like quantum simulations, financial engineering, and drug discovery. In this paper, I apply a hybrid Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) to the classic problem of portfolio diversification. It has been demonstrated that the problem of portfolio construction can be reduced to finding the maximum independent set in market graphs. In the field of combinatorial optimization, the iterative VQA maximum independent set solver can improve optimization performance while mimicking the classical greedy algorithm. To integrate the two ideas, I implement the VQA maximum independent set algorithm to build a portfolio from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. My results show that, at shallow circuit depths, the VQA achieves portfolio selections that are comparable to the maximum independent set formed by the classical linear programming solution.
